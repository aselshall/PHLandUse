Effects of land cover and watershed protection futures on sustainable groundwater management in Hawaiʻi (Bremer et al.)
Land cover scenarios were produced using ARC Map 10 by Laura Brewington and Leah Bremer. Recharge data was produced by Kolja Rotzoll of the United States Geological Survey Pacific Islands Water Center using the Hawaiʻi Groundwater Recharge Tool (note that recharge rasters are for the full island of Oʻahu, but only change in the Pearl Harbor aquifer). The simulation optimization pumping data is not publicly available for security reasons, but obtained by containting Ahmed S. Elshall
